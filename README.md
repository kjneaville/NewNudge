Adulting is hard. The transition to adulthood is more difficult than ever before with more complexity and more responsibility than any other time in history. Nudge is here to help with that transition. Nudge, is an app that strives to make adulting easy and fun. By having different levels of questions and curriculum for core adulting activities. Nudge guides the user on a fun journey to learning and mastering the responsibilities needed to master adulting. 

We used:
Ionic (Hybrid application framework in which you use web programming to create native applications)
Angular 2
HTML/Sass/Typescript
AngularJS
NodeJS
Firebase
D3

Within our app we have four main categories: Financial, Medical, Household, and Automobile. Within each category, are various subcategories. (i.e. for Financial there is Budget, Investment, Retirement, and Taxes) Within each subcategory, there are four levels to progress through. Within each level there is a list of Nudges to complete. Each Nudge contains a large description on how to "adult", steps to complete the task, and resources to external sites for more information.

None of the members of our team came from an app development background, so we chose to use Ionic. This allowed us to use the web programming languages we are all familiar with in order to create an application that builds into three platforms (iOS, Android, and Windows) automatically. We tried to gamify the application as much as possible to turn it into a boring education application into an application that made users excited to use and progress.
